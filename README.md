# FitnessChallenge-IconBlockchain
 Challenge your friend for a Fitness Challenge

## How to use?
*Note: In the wallets folder, there are 2 wallets for the testnet. The passwords are simply the file name.*  
*Note: This project runs only on the testnet*  
*Note: As I understood, if you want to bet 1 ICX, you have to bet 1000000000000000000, maybe I am wrong?*  

1. Run the Java Client and select a wallet
2. Go to Challenge Someone
3. Fill out everything
4. Your target must accept the challenge (you can check under the right tab)
5. If he does, both can submit Fitness Points while the challenge is running, **not before and not afterwards**
6. After the challenge is done you can see the result in the right tab. Bets get automatically paid out.

## What did I learn?
* How to write Python
* How to write an basic Application on the Icon Blockchain
